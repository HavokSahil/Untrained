#1: error: while executing migration 20250412171520: error returned from database: 1419 (HY000): You do not have the SUPER privilege and binary logging is enabled (you *might* want to use the less safe log_bin_trust_function_creators variable)
FIX: 
    $ mysql -u root -p
    mysql> SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
